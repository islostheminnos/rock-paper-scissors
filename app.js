// 1- Design the HTML page
// 2- Add styles


// 3- Use an array which contains "rock", "paper", and "scissors"
// 4- Randomly pick an option from the array above
// 5- Generate an image related to randomly picked option (rock, paper or scissors)
// 6- Generate all 3 images in a div for 5 seconds so the player can have a better game experience
// 7- Program the logic (if player is rock and computer is paper computer wins etc.)
// 8- Create a paragraph element on DOM which contains "player win" or "computer win"



// Maybe I can program a "betting" logic later..
